# Smart Home Client Application

Welcome to the Smart Home Client Application, a GUI-based Java application that allows users to control various smart devices through a client-server architecture. This project utilizes Java for the frontend, SceneBuilder for FXML file creation, and the Object-Oriented Client-Server Framework (OCSF) for backend communication.

## Features

- **Login System**: Users can log in using a secure login system that authenticates against a locally stored SQL database.

- **Smart Devices**: The application supports interaction with five smart devices:
  1. Smart Thermostat
  2. Smart Light System
  3. Smart Lock
  4. Smart Camera
  5. Smart Irrigation System

- **Device Control**: Users can control various features of each smart device, such as adjusting the temperature, changing light colors, viewing camera footage, and more.

- **Client-Server Communication**: The application communicates with the server using the Object-Oriented Client-Server Framework (OCSF). User actions trigger messages sent to the server, and the server responds with the necessary data to update the client's interface.
